The AI engineer iteratively developed the Actor Club Portal application. Key initial steps included setting up a React, FastAPI, MongoDB stack and addressing environment configuration and backend API routing ( prefix). Early bug fixes involved  and missing imports. Subsequent work focused on extensive user requests: implementing a  username format, robust password policies, password change functionality, and admin-controlled photo uploads for users and leadership. The engineer also tackled multiple design overhauls, culminating in applying a user-provided design ( and a screenshot) site-wide. A significant challenge involved persistent issues with photo uploads and display, traced back to missing fields in backend Pydantic models and improper static file serving/CORS configuration, which was resolved by using a dedicated FastAPI endpoint for static files. The engineer also implemented comprehensive member management (cleanup of duplicates, precise population, filtering, enhanced search), dynamic homepage content, updated dues information, and expanded About Us page editing capabilities for admins. The trajectory concludes with the AI beginning to apply a new comprehensive design across the entire site based on a user-provided screenshot.

<product_requirements>
The Actor Club Portal is a web application for an actor's club. It requires secure  username login and a password policy (8-16 characters, min 1 letter, 1 special symbol). Users should be able to change their password. Detailed user profiles (photos, personal details, work, hobbies, talents, height, weight) are essential. Monthly dues (1000 TL/month, Sep-Jun) tracking, with an IBAN for payments (TR15 0001 5001 5800 7314 0364 49, Muzaffer Çağlar İşgören, Vakıfbank İzmir Mersinli Şubesi, Actor Club aidatı içindir description), must be visible on profiles. An Events page (with a Past Events section) and a Members page with case-insensitive search across profile details are required. The homepage displays the founder (Muzaffer Çağlar İşgören), honorary presidents (Göksel Kortay, Kökten Ulaş Birand, Cengiz Karakuzu), and board members (Emre Turgut, Duygu Asker Aksoy, Tuğba Çakı, Utkan Devrim Zeyrek, Seda Ateş) with their teams (Diyojen, Hypatia, Artemis, Hermes). Admin functionalities include user management (accept, add, edit, delete members), comprehensive content editing for all website sections (e.g., Hakkımızda text/photos, management team details/photos, mission/vision, contact info), logo change, and dues management. Non-admin users should not see admin/test accounts. The site must support a specific external design ( and provided screenshots) and display a Actor Club logo with Actor Club Üye Portalı text in Turkish. The pre-login homepage should be viewable after login, and Üyelik Başvurusu should be replaced by Üye Girişi.

<code_architecture>

- : The FastAPI backend handling authentication (JWT), user/member CRUD, dues, events, dynamic content like Hakkımızda and leadership. It has been extensively modified to:
    - Switch login/user creation to  (name.surname format).
    - Implement password policy enforcement.
    - Add  Pydantic model for internal handling of passwords.
    - Add  to  model.
    - Change static file serving from  mount to a direct  endpoint to resolve CORS/display issues.
    - Update  endpoints to handle  and  fields.
- : Main React component for routing and . Updated to handle new navigation and ensure correct homepage routing post-login.
- , , : Core styling.  has been updated to apply global design changes from  and the most recent design screenshot.
- : Landing page. Rewritten to be dynamic, fetching founder, honorary presidents, and board members with their photos from the API. The Hemen Başlayın section and related CTAs have been removed, and the header button changed to Üye Girişi.
- : User authentication. Modified to use  instead of  for login.
-  (referred to as  sometimes): Displays member list. Modified to:
    - Correctly display  or initials for members.
    - Hide admin/test users for non-admin users.
    - Implement case-insensitive search across multiple profile fields.
    - Update team display format (e.g., Diyojen - Tuğba Çakı).
- : Displays individual member details. Modified to:
    - Correctly display .
    - Allow email editing.
    - Update IBAN details display.
- : Admin dashboard. Significantly expanded to include:

- : Hakkımızda page. Enhanced to allow admin editing of:
    - Hero section main photo.
    - Mission and Vision text.
    - Contact information (phone, email, web, address) in both editing form and sidebar display.
- : Navigation component (created/modified). Updated to include a Profilim (My Profile) link and ensure Anasayfa (Homepage) links correctly to the  route (HomePage) after login.
- : A utility script created to delete all existing users and repopulate the database with a curated list of members and admin/test users to resolve duplicate user issues and incorrect member counts.

<pending_tasks>
- Admin should be able to change the Actor Club logo.
- Add Geçmiş Etkinlikler (Past Events) section to Events, admin editable.
- Clicking on a team leader (e.g., Tuğba Çakı) in Üyelerimiz should show only their team members.
- About Us: Management board is incomplete, complete it and allow photo editing for them (though basic admin photo editing for leadership is implemented, specific management board photos might need fine-tuning).
- Finish applying the new design from the  screenshot to all pages, beyond the global CSS and HomePage.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was immediately engaged in a comprehensive design overhaul, applying a new design from a user-provided screenshot () across the entire website. This task was initiated after resolving numerous functional and display issues, including persistent photo upload/display problems, member count discrepancies, and dynamic content requirements.

Specifically, before the current summary request, the AI had just started applying the new design. It began by updating global CSS styles () and then the  component to align with the new aesthetic. The trajectory ends with the AI stating its intention to update the  component next, to conform to this modern design. The content of the website is explicitly requested not to change, only the design and layout. This implies a significant refactoring of frontend components to match the visual style of the provided screenshot.
