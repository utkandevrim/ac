The AI engineer successfully built the Actor Club Portal application iteratively. Initially, it set up the full-stack (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) MVP, including core pages like homepage, login, member list, user profiles, events, about us, and an admin panel. Key challenges included correctly configuring environment variables and ensuring backend API calls used the  prefix. The engineer addressed several bugs, notably a  during admin password creation and a missing  import in the admin panel.

Subsequent updates focused on user-requested enhancements: implementing a custom color theme, adding admin functionality for dues management, enabling admin editing for the Biz Kimiz section, and refining the management team display. The AI also handled multiple design overhauls, first a modern, artistic theme and then replicating specific external designs provided by the user (a screenshot and a ). The final task initiated involved a comprehensive site-wide design application from the  example, along with significant changes to user authentication (username format, password policy, password change), admin-controlled photo uploads, and full CRUD capabilities for all website content. The last action was generating new user credentials adhering to the new policies.

The Actor Club Portal is a web application designed for an actor's club. It features secure user login to access content. Each user has a detailed profile including photos, personal details, work, hobbies, talents, height, and weight. The homepage showcases the founder (Muzaffer Çağlar İşgören), honorary presidents (Göksel Kortay, Kökten Ulaş Birand, Cengiz Karakuzu), and board members (Emre Turgut, Duygu Asker Aksoy, Tuğba Çakı, Utkan Devrim Zeyrek, Seda Ateş), with their associated teams (Diyojen, Hypatia, Artemis, Hermes). Members track monthly dues (1000 TL/month, Sep-Jun) on their profile, with unpaid dues linking to an IBAN. An Events page allows admins to add events with photos. The Admin panel enables user management (accepting, adding, editing, deleting members), comprehensive content editing for all website sections (e.g., Hakkımızda text/photos, management team details/photos, mission/vision), and dues management (viewing all members' dues, marking as paid). A Members page displays all members with search functionality. User passwords must be 8-16 characters, including at least one letter and one special character. The site language is Turkish, and it features a small Actor Club logo in the top-left with Actor Club Üye Portalı text. User login format will be .

<code_architecture>

- : The core FastAPI backend application. It manages user authentication (login, logout, JWT token handling), CRUD operations for users, members, dues, events, and dynamic content like Hakkımızda and management team details. It uses  for asynchronous MongoDB interactions and  for secure password hashing. This file has been extensively modified to add new endpoints, update data models (e.g., founder name, team names), and implement authentication logic.
- : The main React component, serving as the application's entry point for routing. It orchestrates different pages and provides an  for global authentication state management. It has been updated to reflect the new navigation and design themes.
- , , : These files define the global and component-specific styling using Tailwind CSS. They have been frequently updated and rewritten to implement various design themes, color palettes (white, light blue, cream), and visual layouts according to user requests, including the latest  design.
- : Renders the landing page, displaying information about the founder, honorary presidents, and the management board with their respective teams. This component has undergone multiple rewrites to conform to the evolving design requirements and content structure.
- : Provides the user authentication interface. This component is crucial for user access control and will require updates for the new  username format.
- : Displays a list of all registered members, including a search functionality.
- : Presents detailed information for an individual member, including personal data, projects, and monthly dues status. Changes were made to show dues payment status and IBAN.
- : The central administration dashboard. It integrates various sub-components for managing users, dues, and website content (e.g., Hakkımızda section, events, management team details). Its structure has been modified to include new tabs and routes for enhanced admin functionalities.
- : A component integrated into , specifically for administrators to view and mark member dues as paid, enabling the required dues tracking system.
- : Displays the Hakkımızda (About Us) page content, now including Mission and Vision sections. It includes conditional rendering for admin editing capabilities.
- : A component for administrators to edit the text and potentially photos within the Hakkımızda and Mission/Vision sections.
- : Provides a React context for managing user authentication state across the frontend application, ensuring authenticated routes are protected.
- : A utility Python script used initially to populate the MongoDB database with predefined admin and member data, including default passwords and IBAN.

<pending_tasks>
- Apply the  design across the *entire site*.
- Implement user login with  as username format.
- Enforce password policy (min 8, max 16 chars, 1 letter, 1 special symbol) for user creation/update.
- Enable users to change their password post-login.
- Implement admin-only photo upload functionality (from file) for all user profiles and management team members.
- Grant admin full CRUD control (edit, change, delete, add) over *all* website information.
- Provide a non-admin user credential for testing.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was working on the comprehensive updates requested in Chat Message 164 and 171. The immediate focus was on adopting the design from the provided  across the entire application and implementing significant changes to user management and content control. Specifically, the AI has already analyzed the  design, applied its general CSS (), and rewritten the  to match the new aesthetic. The last completed action was the generation of new user credentials (including admin accounts like / and sample normal user accounts like /) to align with the new  username format and the stricter password policy. The system is currently in a state where the new design is partially applied (mostly on the homepage and global styles), and the new user credential structure is defined, but the underlying authentication logic, site-wide design application, photo upload features, full admin CRUD capabilities for all content, and user password change functionality still need to be implemented.
