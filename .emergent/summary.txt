The AI engineer's work on the Actor Club Portal application encompassed significant feature additions, design overhauls, and crucial bug fixes. Initially, the focus was on core functionalities like user authentication (username/password policies, password change), dynamic content management, and a site-wide design application based on a provided screenshot. Key challenges included persistent photo upload/display issues,  integration problems in React, and backend  exceptions.

Later, the engineer addressed specific user requests such as refining homepage content, rectifying admin user creation failures, implementing user password generation and self-service password changes, and resolving critical mobile responsiveness and dark mode compatibility issues across the site. A major security vulnerability (hardcoded JWT secret) was identified during a pre-deployment health check and promptly fixed by externalizing the key to environment variables.

The most recent development involved building a comprehensive Kampanyalar (Campaigns) page with a unique QR code-based eligibility verification system. This included extensive backend work (new models, endpoints, helper functions for dues checking) and frontend development (new components, route integration, QR code generation). Admin functionality to manage these campaigns (add, edit, delete, photo upload) was then integrated into the . The trajectory concludes with an error encountered while attempting to load the  after implementing the campaign management features, leaving this new section unverified.

<product_requirements>
The Actor Club Portal is a web application designed for an actor's club. It features secure  username login, robust password policies (8-16 characters, min 1 letter, 1 special symbol), and user password change functionality. User profiles require fields for photos, personal, work, hobby, and talent details (height, weight). A monthly dues tracking system (1000 TL/month, Sep-Jun) with a specific IBAN for payments must be visible. The application includes an Events page (with a Past Events section) and a Members page offering case-insensitive search across profile details. The homepage displays the founder (Muzaffer Çağlar İşgören), honorary presidents, and board members with their teams. Admin roles facilitate user management (accept, add, edit, delete), comprehensive content editing for all sections (e.g., Hakkımızda text/photos, management team details/photos, mission/vision, contact info), and dues management. Non-admin users should not see admin/test accounts. The site must adopt a specific modern design and display the Actor Club logo with Actor Club Üye Portalı text. Post-login, Üye Girişi on the homepage should be replaced by the user's name. A new Kampanyalar page details member discounts, with eligibility based on paid past dues. Eligible members receive a 15-minute active QR code for verification, redirecting to a page showing member photo/name and kampanyaya katılabilir, or Kampanya Geçersiz otherwise.

<current_work>
The AI engineer was most recently focused on implementing the Kampanyalar (Campaigns) page, including a QR code-based eligibility verification system. This involved significant backend development in  to add  and  models, helper functions for QR code generation, and dues payment checks, along with new API endpoints for managing campaigns and verifying QR codes. On the frontend, new  and  components were created, routes were added in , and a Kampanyalar link was integrated into . The  library was installed and used within  for dynamic QR code generation. Sample campaign data was populated via a script.

Subsequently, admin management for these campaigns (add, edit, delete, photo upload) was integrated into the . This included adding new states, CRUD functions, a Kampanyalar tab to the , and a dedicated  section with modals for creating and editing campaigns.

The current state is that the  is encountering a loading error, specifically preventing access to and verification of the newly implemented Kampanyalar tab and its features. The trajectory ended immediately after attempting to test the  and observing this error, with the backend appearing to be running.
